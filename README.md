# GodotSteam Documentation Source
This branch is stores the source code for the GodotSteam documentation.  Any changes to the docs needs to be made to this repository.  The documentation site is made with [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material For MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) so everything is written in Markdown.  That being said, there are some custom things added in.

Everyone is welcome to modify, correct, and add to the documentation!
