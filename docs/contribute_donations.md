# Donating To GodotSteam

---

If code isn't your strong-suit or you are feeling generous, you can always donate to the GodotSteam project through one of these platforms.  Doing so will get you a variety of little perks based on your donation amount.

Everyone gets added to our documentation's contributor list and one link is permitted per donor.  [You may have to e-mail us at donors@godotsteam.com](mailto:donors@godotsteam.com){ target="_blank" } as your contact information isn't shared with us through Github Sponsors.

We also have to manually add you in the Discord server, if you are a member.  Just reach out to one of the moderators to get your role!

And, most importantly, thank you!
