# Skillet

{==
## :fontawesome-solid-question: What Is It?
==}

An open-source and free-to-play game built to showcase GodotSteam's functionality. [The game being shared as open-source](https://github.com/GodotSteam/Skillet/){ target="\_blank" } will allow developers to see how things work in Steamworks and Godot with real-world examples. Users may be copy and modify the code for their own needs and games. Since it is meant to be educational, it will be designed in a somewhat simplified way to accommodate all levels.

Planned release for Skillet is sometime in December with the repo going live sometime in October or once substantial work has been completed on the main game loop and systems.

{==
## :simple-steam: Showcasing Steamworks
==}

Skillet will showcase the majority of Valve's Steamworks SDK with the following:

- Achievements and statistics
- Workshop / UGC
- Inventory
- Input
- Apps like checking other owned games and DLC
- Remote Play for online / local co-op

More to come as development continues.

{==
## :material-gamepad-square: Game Modes
==}

### Trial by Fire

The normal mode. Players must avoid being ignited by various arena hazards. Though players cannot attack each other directly, everything is very bouncy and causes knockback.  Watch out.  Last player standing wins.

### Hot Potato

Standing on the heated up pan will increase "combustion" meter; when it's full the player burst into flames. Various objects get tossed into the pan as the match goes on and melt down. Use them while you can.  Last player standing wins.

### Pass The Torch

A tag-like mode where one player starts as The Match and must tag other players, igniting them. These burning players may now also spread the fire while they have life left to do so.  Last player standing wins.

### Fire-Water-Sponge

A take on Rock-Paper-Scissors where players are split into three groups that can only affect the appropriate teams. Fire burns sponge, sponge absorbs water, water douses fire.  Last team standing wins.

{==
## :material-store: Support Through DLC
==}

Since Skillet is free-to-play, we will be offering two DLC packs: Godot Dinner Party and GodotSteam Snack Pack. Of course, [any donations through Github Sponsors goes towards Skillet's development and the general GodotSteam development.](https://github.com/sponsors/Gramps){ target="\_blank" }

### Godot Dinner Party

This DLC contains some Godot-themed skins and cosmetics as well as other Godot-made games' cosmetics. All proceeds from this DLC go to the Godot Foundation after Valve's cut. [You can also donate to Godot directly here.](https://fund.godotengine.org/){ target="\_blank" }

### GodotSteam Snack Pack

This DLC contains additional skins and cosmetics based on GodotSteam and other creations.

{==
## :material-gamepad-variant: Featuring Godot-Made Games
==}

At launch, Skillet has some additional cosmetics and skins from based on other Godot-made games. If you own these games, the skins will unlock when you boot it up. The cosmetics and skins will drop into your Steam inventory and can be traded with friends or other players. Additionally, some will be available in the [**Godot Dinner Party DLC**](#support-through-dlc) that will release on launch too.

Post-launch we will reach out to more devs about adding more cosmetics and skins and, of course, any developer making a game with Godot can create a pull request in Skillet's repo to add their own cosmetics to the game.
