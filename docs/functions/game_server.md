## beginAuthSession

!!! function "beginAuthSession( ```int``` auth_ticket, ```uint64_t``` steam_id )"
	Authenticate the ticket from the entity Steam ID to be sure it is valid and isn't reused. The ticket is created on the entity with [getAuthSessionTicket](/functions/game_server/#getauthsessionticket) and then needs to be provided over the network for the other end to validate. This registers for [validate_auth_ticket_response](/signals/game_server/#validate_auth_ticket_response) callbacks if the entity goes offline or cancels the ticket. [See EAuthSessionResponse for more information](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/steam_api#EAuthSessionResponse){ target="_blank" }. When the multiplayer session terminates you must call [endAuthSession](/functions/game_server/#endauthsession).

	**Returns:** int

## cancelServerAuthTicket

!!! function "cancelServerAuthTicket( ```uint32``` auth_ticket )"
	Cancel auth ticket from [getAuthSessionTicket](/functions/game_server/#getauthsessionticket); called when no longer playing game with the entity you gave the ticket to.

	**Returns:** void

## getAuthSessionTicket

!!! function "getServerAuthSessionTicket()"
	Retrieve a authentication ticket to be sent to the entity who wishes to authenticate you. After calling this you can send the ticket to the entity where they can then call [beginAuthSession](/functions/game_server/#beginauthsession) to verify this entities integrity. When creating a ticket for use by the ISteamUserAuth/AuthenticateUserTicket Web API, the calling application should wait for the [get_auth_session_ticket_response](/signals/game_server/#get_auth_session_ticket_response) callback generated by the API call before attempting to use the ticket to ensure that the ticket has been communicated to the server. If this callback does not come in a timely fashion (10 - 20 seconds), then your client is not connected to Steam, and the [authenticateUserTicket](/functions/game_server/#authenticateuserticket) call will fail because it can not authenticate the user.

	Triggers a [get_auth_session_ticket_response](/signals/game_server/#get_auth_session_ticket_reponse) callback.

	**Returns:** dictionary

	Contains the following keys:
	
	* id (uint32_t)
	* buffer (PoolByteArray)
	* ticket_size (uint32_t)

## getNextOutgoingPacket

!!! function "getNextOutgoingPacket()"
	Gets a packet that the master server updater needs to send out on UDP when in GameSocketShare mode. GameSocketShare mode can be enabled when calling [serverInit](/functions/game_server/#serverInit).
	
	**Note:** This should only ever be called **after** calling [handleIncomingPacket](/functions/game_server/#handleincomingpacket) for any packets that came in that frame.

	**Note:** This **must** be called repeatedly each frame until it returns 0 when in GameSocketShare mode.
	
	**Returns:** dictionary

	* length (int)
	* out (PoolByteArray)
	* address (uint32)
	* port (uint16)

## getPublicIP

!!! function "getPublicIP()"
	Gets the public IP of the server according to Steam. This is useful when the server is behind NAT and you want to advertise its IP in a lobby for other clients to directly connect to.
	
	**Returns:** dictionary

	Contains the following keys:

	* ipv4 (int)
	* ipv6 (int)
	* type (int)

	Gets the Steam ID of the game server.

	**Returns:** uint64_t

## handleIncomingPacket

!!! function "handleIncomingPacket( ```int``` packet, ```string``` ip, ```int``` port )"
	Handles a Steam master server packet when in GameSocketShare mode. When in GameSocketShare mode, instead of ISteamGameServer creating its own socket to talk to the master server on, it lets the game use its socket to forward messages back and forth. This prevents us from requiring server ops to open up yet another port in their firewalls. This should be called whenever a packet that starts with 0xFFFFFFFF comes in. That means it's for us. The IP and port parameters are used when you've elected to multiplex the game server's UDP socket rather than having the master server updater use its own sockets. Source engine games use this to simplify the job of the server admins, so they don't have to open up more ports on their firewalls. Only <em>after</em> calling this, you should call [getNextOutgoingPacket](/functions/game_server/#getnextoutgoingpacket). GameSocketShare mode can be enabled when calling [initGameServer](/functions/game_server/#initgameserver).

	**Returns:** dictionary

	Contains the following key:

	* data (PoolByteArray)

## initGameServer

!!! function "initGameServer( ```dictionary``` connect_data, ```uint32_t``` app_id, ```string``` version_string )"
	This is called by [serverInit](/functions/game_server/#serverinit) and will usually not need to be called directly.

	The **connect_data** dictionary should contain the following keys:

	* ip (string)
	* game_port (uint16)
	* query_port (uint16)
	
	**Returns:** bool

	**Note:** The following, if set, must be set before calling [logOn](/functions/game_server/#logon); they may not be changed after.
