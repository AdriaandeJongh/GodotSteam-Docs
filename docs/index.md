# GodotSteam Documentation

## Introduction

This is the documentation site for GodotSteam, a Steamworks module for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org){ target="_blank" } which includes a fully-functional version for all versions of Godot from 2.x to 4.x as well as a GDNative plug-in. Here you can find tutorials, lists of functions and signals, and even [games currently using GodotSteam](games/games.md).

Support for the project is provided through the [GodotSteam GitHub issues page](https://github.com/CoaguCo-Industries/GodotSteam/issues){ target="_blank" } by e-mail, or discussion in our Discord server.

## Pre-builds

Most people just want to download something and go. For that, we have a few different options: either pre-compiled module-enabled editors and templates, the GDNative (Godot 3.x) plug-in, or the GDExtension (Godot 4.x) plug-in.

Make sure you **don't mix and match** the pre-compiled editors with the plug-ins or you'll have a really bad time.
