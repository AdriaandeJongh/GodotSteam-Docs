# GodotSteam Documentation

## Introduction

This is the documentation site for GodotSteam, a Steamworks module for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org){ target="_blank" } which includes a fully-functional version for all versions of Godot from 2.x to 4.x as well as a GDNative plug-in. Here you can find tutorials, lists of functions and signals, and even [games currently using GodotSteam](games.md).

Support for the project is provided through the [GodotSteam Github issues page](https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam/issues){ target="_blank" } by e-mail, or discussion in our Discord server.

Last, but absolutely not least, make sure you are logged into your Steam client if testing your game or any scenes. Otherwise you will experience some pretty brutal crashing.
